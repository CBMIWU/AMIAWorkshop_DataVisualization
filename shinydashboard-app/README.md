---------------------------------------------------

**Purpose**: a demo of shinydashboard package during AMIA Joint Summits 2015 Workshop  "Visualizing Operational Informatics Data and KPIs Using R"
**Authors**: Leslie McIntosh, PhD; Kanstantsyia (Connie) Zabarouskaya, MBA; 
**Developer**: Kanstantsyia (Connie) Zabarouskaya (GitHub ConnieZ)

**ATTRIBUTIONS**

We would like to thank developers of the following products for the opportunity to use their great tools: 
- RStudio team - Shiny and shinydashboard packages
- Ramnath Vaidyanathan - rCharts package  
- Simon Muller - BulletGraphSipemu.txt
- Hadley Wickham - plyr package

**GENERAL USAGE NOTES**

**Description**: This project demonstrates good practices in visualizing data in a dashboard. To run the demo dashboard, download the dashboard folder with all the included files, and run any of the R files inside RStudio.

**Dependencies**: At least R 3.0 and R packages: shinydashboard (depends on shiny, htmltools, htmlwidgets), rCharts, plyr, grid; source file BulletGraphSipemu.txt

**Input**: The data are fed from the folder called /data. The data used in the dashboard are a sample of CBMI operational data, but it has been altered in a way to preserve confidentiality of business related information. However, the names of products (software tools) are real.

**Output**: A slick bootstrap-based dashboard with interactive charts and bullet graphs.
